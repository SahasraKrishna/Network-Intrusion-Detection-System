# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for protecting networks and hosts from 
sophisticated and dynamic cyber-attacks. The nature of these threats is constantly changing, and 
hence, adaptive models that can identify and mitigate attacks in real time are required.  
This project produces a two-stage deep learning approach that integrates Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto-Encoders (AE) for effective detection and classification of 
cyber-attacks. The LSTM network exploits its sequential processing capabilities to analyse 
temporal patterns within network traffic, whereas the AE focuses on dimensionality reduction 
and anomaly detection, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture complex attack patterns. 
The use of LSTM is particularly advantageous for processing network packet sequences, as it 
retains the influence of prior packets on subsequent ones, capturing the temporal dependencies 
critical for intrusion detection. The AE ensures efficient handling of complex attack patterns by 
learning compressed representations of the data. 
This project will be a significant contribution to the field of intrusion detection, which presents a 
scalable and adaptive solution to the challenges of modern cyber-security, while offering 
valuable insights into developing IDS models that can effectively respond to the ever-changing 
threat landscape.
